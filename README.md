# BigALibertarianTests
Big A Libertarian Test is a test collection to see how much of a libertarian the test taker is.

# New version Coming #

## Why ##

* I don't like writing code more than once. So when I create a test, I just want the test to be a document, that gets loaded into the existing code.
* I like unit testing. That is, I like to know when I break something everytime I make a change, so I know what to fix.

## New Features Roadmap ##

01. List of tests. This is an index file of tests that are ready to be ran, and a list of tests that are still coming.
02. The test. This is a file that contains the test, its assumptions, descriptions, questions, and answers
03. Routing. That is all tests will now load by routing, so that we can actually take advantage of the routing tables.
04. Unit Testing. This is mostly for the controller, but I like to add it to the directives.
05. Directives for the questions themselves. More modular design.
06. Certification of completion page.
