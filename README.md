# What is this. #

Have you though, "How can I get people to understand that there is no morality in supporting any government? How can I show that the use of force in any form except in self defense is amoral?"

Well, this project is a collection of tests that are designed to question the ideas that lead to our enslavement by those who we keep voting for.

The last test I compose will be the big one, **Voting: Oppressing others by using a mob to do what you cannot force people to do yourself.**
