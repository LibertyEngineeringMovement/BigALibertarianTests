# ARCHIVED the rewrite will be done in newer versions of Angular.

# What is it? #

This is the rewrite of the BigALibertarianTests.

# Why? #

Because the solid open source client side test environment is needed.

# No, I mean why Open Source?#

Because Good ideas want to be free to evolve. Keeping them caged up in copyrights and patents cause good ideas to wither.
